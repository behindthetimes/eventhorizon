"blackhole" can be used as a blocklist in the Pi-hole Admin Console. The blocklists can be found under "Main Navigation>Settings" and in the "Blocklists" tab in the settings page. Simply paste "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/behindthetimes/eventhorizon/master/blackhole" into the URL addition line, and hit "Save and Update." This should update your blacklists.

This is a list of DNS's I have compiled from multiple blacklists for disabling ads, tracking, malware, and malicious sites. 
#
There may be duplicates in these lists, and I am too lazy to sort them all out. Besides, the pihole will sort through and throw out the duplicates anyway.
